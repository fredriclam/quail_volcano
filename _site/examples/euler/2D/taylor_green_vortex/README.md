This case involves the well-known inviscid Taylor-Green vortex configuration. 
  - Periodic boundaries in the x- and y-directions
  - 8th order Lagrange polynomials on one element
  - Colocated scheme with Gauss-Lobatto points, i.e. solution nodes and quadrature points are prescribed to be the same
  - Source term to account for compressibility effects
  - Post-processing
    - Pressure contour with mesh and element IDs displayed
